Hey there, 
Welcome to my website. 
This is the lightbox I'm trying to have https://codepen.io/ngatmaitan/pen/GGvxeW
As it works for me now, the image opens but without buttons on the lightbox(left,right,exit).
Please let me know if can see the problem or a solution, or if you want to point out any other things. 
The css is built also for the main index page, that is why is so big.
Thank you in advance for you help!

edit: I realised my logo.gif and my background.jpg are not connected because they were in another image folder, the original one, so I added them now to the images folder.
